This is where all of the source code is place. In order to compile, open up a
terminal at this location and type:

javac *.java

The main method is located in ClydesAdventure, so to run the game, type:

java ClydesAdventure


A .jar will be made eventually, to make this easier to run. It will be found in
the root directory.
