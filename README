JClyde is a Java implementation of Clyde's Adventure, a DOS game developed and
published by Moonlite Software back in 1992. The point of the game is to guide
Clyde, an adventuring wizard, around a castle in search of a hidden treasure.
Along the way Clyde must gather gems, to advance to later levels, and energy,
as his depletes with every move, and will die if it runs out. In his way lie
traps, puzzles, and items that can be manipulated by his magic wand.

While it wasn't necessary, I built this code to be as generic as possible,
which means that with a little modification, it can act as a core for many
kinds of sidescrollers. It was based on some sidescroller code provided by
Andrew Davison, from his book "Killer Game Programming in Java", though much
of it has been altered (or completely rewritten) to suit my coding style.

I give complete permission to use and modify this code in its entirety, as
long as some credit is given to me. Furthermore, I encourage its use in
educational environments, due to its heavy documentation, utilization of
simple design patterns, and my excessive use of encapsulation.
