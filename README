JClyde is a Java implementation of Clyde's Adventure, a DOS game developed and
published by Moonlite Software back in 1992. The point of the game is to guide
Clyde, an adventuring wizard, around a castle in search of a hidden treasure.
Along the way Clyde must gather gems, to advance to later levels, and energy,
as his depletes with every move, and will die if it runs out. In his way lie
traps, puzzles, and items that can be manipulated by his magic wand.
